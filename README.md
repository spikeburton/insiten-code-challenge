# Target Acquisitions App

Here's the app! âœ¨ I used the `faker` node module to generate seed data, which can be found in `db/seeds.js`. The React frontend can be found in the `client` directory. I am using Heroku for deployment, with JSON server also being used to serve the static files from the React build. As a user, you are able to add a target acquisiton, view all target acqusitions, edit the details for any company, and delete any target. I hope you enjoy checking it out!
